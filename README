Applet-Fu solves three important problems when deploying Java applets in
hetergeneous environments:

(1) Eliminates "Click to Activate" message in Internet Explorer.
    See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eolas
 
(2) Enables the minimum JRE version required to run an applet to be set, and
    uses the browser's own built-in mechanism for installing plugins to
    install the correct JVM, if needed.

(3) Uses the standards-compliant <object> tag, which replaces the deprecated
    <applet> tag in HTML 4.

Usage: applet_fu.run({attr1:val1, attr2:val2, ...},
                     {param1:val1, param2:val2, ...},
                     minimumVersion, fallbackContent);
